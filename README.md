# Pokemon TCGdex

A Multilanguage PokÃ©mon TCG Database with Pictures and most of the informations contained on the cards

## Use the datas

The easiest way to use the datas is via our [Javascript/Typescript SDK](https://github.com/tcgdex/javascript-sdk).

You can however build this yourself via our [compiler](https://github.com/tcgdex/compiler) or download the already build [compiled database](https://github.com/tcgdex/distribution).

## SDKs (API Wrapper but SDK is way cooler ðŸ˜„)

We currently officially support theses SDKs

- [Javascript/Typescript SDK](https://github.com/tcgdex/javascript-sdk)
- [PHP SDK](https://github.com/tcgdex/php-sdk)

_If you have made a SDK you can start a [discussion](https://github.com/tcgdex/cards-database/discussions/new) to be added here_
